# YARP (Yet Another React Package)
This is a simple React package that I created using things that I constantly use in my projects.

## Installation
You need to create a `.npmrc` file in your project root directory and add the following line to it:
```bash
@curvu:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

Then you can install the package as you would normally do.
