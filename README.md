# My React package
This is a simple React package that I created using things that I constantly use in my projects.

## Installation
You can install this package using npm or yarn.

But first, you need to create a `.npmrc` file in your project root directory and add the following line to it:
```bash
@curvu:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

Then you can install the package using the following commands:
```bash
npm install @curvu/react --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

```bash
yarn add @curvu/react --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```
